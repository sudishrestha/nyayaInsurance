1. Develop a simple odoo CRUD module/App named "insurance" which contains data of insurance claims for e.g Insuree name , age, address,claim amount , status of claims (like approved, rejected), date of claim etc. (insurance_app)

2. Develop a feature to generate a claim from the existing odoo invoice for e.g  add the button in invoice to generate claim and so that it converts the name of customer to insuree name, total amount in invoice to total claim amount etc.(invoice_extended)
